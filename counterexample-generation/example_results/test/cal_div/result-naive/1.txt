Let me analyze and fix this proof step by step.

1. Error Analysis:
- The first error shows the loop invariant `7 <= y` is not maintained at the end of the loop body.
- The second error shows the assertion `191 >= 7 * (x + 1)` fails, which is related to the loop's termination condition.

The core issue is that the invariants don't properly capture the relationship between x and y throughout the loop's execution. The loop calculates how many times 7 fits into 191 (x) and the remainder (y).

2. Repair Strategy:
We need to strengthen the invariants to:
- Maintain the mathematical relationship between x and y (y = 191 - 7*x)
- Ensure x never exceeds the point where 7*x would exceed 191
- Keep y within bounds (7 ≤ y initially, but this changes as the loop progresses)

The key is to recognize that the loop condition `7 <= y` will eventually become false, so we need invariants that work both during and after the loop.

3. Corrected Code:
```rust
use vstd::prelude::*;

verus! {

#[verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
fn cal_div() -> (r: (u32, u32))
    ensures
        r.0 == 27,
        r.1 == 2,
{
    let mut x: u32 = 0;
    let mut y: u32 = 191;
    while 7 <= y
    invariant
        y == 191 - 7 * x,
        x <= 27,
    decreases y
    {
        assert(x < 28); // Ensure x doesn't go beyond 27

        // Assert the bound before updating y
        // This prevents underflow by ensuring that the result is always non-negative
        assert(191 >= 7 * (x + 1));

        x = x + 1;
        y = 191 - 7 * x;
    }
    (x, y)
}

} // verus!

fn main() {}
```

Key changes made:
1. Replaced `7 <= y` invariant with `y == 191 - 7 * x` to maintain the exact relationship between x and y
2. Added `x <= 27` as an invariant to ensure x never exceeds the maximum value where 7*x ≤ 191
3. Kept the decreases clause since y is still decreasing

The new invariants properly capture:
- The mathematical relationship between x and y
- The upper bound on x
- The termination condition (when y < 7)

This should now verify correctly while maintaining all the original functionality and postconditions.
