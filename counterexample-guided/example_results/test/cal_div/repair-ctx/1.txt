Let me analyze the errors and counterexamples to fix this proof.

1. Error Analysis:
- The first error shows the loop invariant `7 <= y` fails at the end of the loop body. This happens because when the loop exits, `y` will be less than 7.
- The second error shows the assertion `191 >= 7 * (x + 1)` fails when x reaches 27 or higher. The counterexamples clearly demonstrate this.

2. Counterexample Analysis:
- The counterexamples show that when x reaches 27, the assertion fails because 7*(27+1) = 196 > 191.
- The loop should actually stop when x reaches 27 (since 191/7 ≈ 27.285), but the current invariants don't properly constrain x to stay below 28.

3. Repair Strategy:
- We need to strengthen the loop invariant to properly bound x to stay ≤ 27.
- The invariant `191 >= 7 * x` is correct but not strong enough - we need to ensure x never exceeds 27.
- We should modify the invariants to:
  - Keep track of the relationship between x and y (y = 191 - 7*x)
  - Ensure x stays within bounds (x ≤ 27)
  - Maintain the loop condition (7 ≤ y while the loop runs)

4. Corrected Code:
```rust
use vstd::prelude::*;

verus! {

#[verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
fn cal_div() -> (r: (u32, u32))
    ensures
        r.0 == 27,
        r.1 == 2,
{
    let mut x: u32 = 0;
    let mut y: u32 = 191;
    while 7 <= y
    invariant
        y == 191 - 7 * x,
        x <= 27,
        7 * x <= 191,
    decreases y
    {
        assert(x < 28); // Ensure x doesn't go beyond 27

        // Assert the bound before updating y
        // This prevents underflow by ensuring that the result is always non-negative
        assert(191 >= 7 * (x + 1));

        x = x + 1;
        y = 191 - 7 * x;
    }
    (x, y)
}

} // verus!

fn main() {}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added the exact relationship `y == 191 - 7 * x` to the invariant
2. Added explicit bound `x <= 27` to prevent x from growing too large
3. Kept `7 * x <= 191` which is equivalent to the original `191 >= 7 * x` but more clearly expresses the mathematical relationship

These changes ensure:
- The loop will terminate when x reaches 27 (y becomes 191 - 7*27 = 2 < 7)
- All assertions and invariants will hold throughout the loop execution
- The postconditions (returning (27, 2)) will be satisfied
