You are a professional Verus formal verification expert. Your task is to generate correct proofs for the given Rust verus program.\n\nPlease carefully analyze the following Rust/Verus code, understand its requires and ensures specifications, then generate complete proof that can pass Verus verification.\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NEVER MODIFY THE ORIGINAL CODE LOGIC**\n**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - VIOLATING THESE WILL RESULT IN FAILURE**\n**DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES:**\n1. **NEVER EVER modify, change, alter, or delete ANY original code content**\n2. **NEVER modify the original requires/ensures specifications**\n3. **NEVER change function signatures, parameters, names, or return types**\n4. **NEVER alter existing code logic, control flow, or program structure**\n5. **NEVER modify, delete, or change existing variable declarations or assignments**\n6. **NEVER change existing expressions, statements, or return values**\n7. **NEVER remove any existing code lines**\n8. **NEVER change the order of existing statements**\n9. **NEVER modify comments that are part of the original code**\n10. **NEVER change ANY character of the original code structure**\n11. **NEVER replace the original implementation with a different one**\n12. **NEVER change the algorithm or logic of the function**\n\n**CRITICAL RULE: PRESERVE EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER OF ORIGINAL CODE**\n**You can ONLY ADD proof annotations. You CANNOT modify, delete, or change anything that exists in the original code. Think of the original code as READ-ONLY - you can only supplement it with additional proof content.**\n\n**WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ADD (AND ONLY THIS):**\n- Loop invariants: `invariant {{ condition }}`\n- Assertions: `assert(condition);`\n- Proof blocks: `proof {{ /* proof code */ }}`\n- Helper lemmas as separate functions\n- Comments explaining proof strategy\n- Decreases clauses for recursive functions\n\n**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN PROOF METHODS:**\n- NEVER use `assume(false)` or any contradictory assumptions\n- NEVER use `#[verifier(external_body)]` or similar verification-skipping attributes\n- NEVER use `assume()` to bypass proof obligations\n- You MUST provide genuine proofs that work with the given implementation\n\n**CRITICAL: NEVER DELETE RETURN STATEMENTS!**\n**If the original code returns `sum`, you MUST keep `sum` as the return value!**\n**If the original code returns `a + b`, you MUST keep `a + b` as the return value!**\n**Always preserve ALL return statements and expressions EXACTLY as they appear!**\n\n**SPECIFIC EXAMPLE - DO NOT DELETE RETURN STATEMENTS:**\nOriginal add function:\n```rust\nfn add(a: u32, b: u32) -> (result: u32) {{ \n    let sum = a + b; \n    sum  // <- THIS MUST BE PRESERVED!\n}}\n```\nCORRECT version (preserves return):\n```rust\nfn add(a: u32, b: u32) -> (result: u32) {{ \n    let sum = a + b; \n    assert(sum == a + b);  // ADD proof annotation\n    sum  // <- PRESERVE the original return!\n}}\n```\nWRONG version (deletes return):\n```rust\nfn add(a: u32, b: u32) -> (result: u32) {{ \n    let sum = a + b; \n    proof {{ /* ... */ }}\n    // <- MISSING 'sum' return! FORBIDDEN!\n}}\n```\n\n**Original Code:**\n```rust\n{code}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your response must contain ONLY the complete Rust/Verus code, starting with 'use vstd::prelude::*;' and ending with '}} // verus!'. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, code blocks, or other content before or after the code. The output must be immediately executable by Verus.**\n\nPlease generate the complete Verus code with proofs:
