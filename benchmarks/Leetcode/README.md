# verus-study-cases-leetcode


## Overview

This project contains several problems selected from leetcode. For each problem, we give a not-brute-force solution and prove its correctness with the formal verification tool Verus.


## Verus

## Verification

Install the Verus (check Verus official site)

Modify the path of "Verifier" in Makefile and run the verifier by command line.

(Since each problem is stand alone, we do not offer the code to test all verification code. If you think it necessary, you can make a PR)
